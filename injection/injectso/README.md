### Overview

This is a reverse-engineered pseudocode representation of an Android process injection tool called "injectso". The tool is designed to inject shared libraries (.so files) into running Android processes using ptrace system calls.

Malware injection
Privilege escalation
Security bypass
Unauthorized system access

Educational Purpose Only: This pseudocode is provided for educational and security research purposes to understand injection techniques and develop countermeasures.

### How It Works

Process Discovery: Scans /proc/ to find target processes by name
Process Attachment: Uses ptrace to attach to the target process
Memory Allocation: Calls mmap in target process to allocate executable memory
Library Resolution: Finds addresses of system libraries (libc, linker)
Shellcode Injection: Injects ARM assembly code that calls dlopen
Library Loading: Forces target process to load specified shared library
Execution: Injected library code runs with target process privileges

### Technical Requirements

Platform: Android ARM (32-bit)
Privileges: Root access typically required for ptrace
Target: Any running Android process
Dependencies: System libraries (libc.so, linker)

### Detection & Prevention

Monitor ptrace system calls
Implement anti-debugging techniques
Use application sandboxing
Regular security audits of running processes
SELinux policies to restrict ptrace usage
